SRDB is a command-line tool for searching and replacing values within a database, designed
not to damage serialised objects. It is intended for use when migrating WordPress databases
but is suitable for any similar problem.

This command-line tool is almost entirely based on interconnect/it's excellent search & replace
tool:

  We just wanted something to run on the command-line, so we modified it.

Usage: 
  srdb [options] <search> <replace>

Arguments:

  search            String to look for
  replace           String to replace matches with

Options:

  -h <host>       MySQL server hostname. (Default: localhost)
  -p <password>           MySQL user's password
  -u <password>           MySQL account name (Default: root)
  -d <password>           MySQL database (Default: wordpress)
  --tables <tables>       Comma-separated list of tables to search within (Default: all tables)
